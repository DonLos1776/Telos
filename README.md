## Purpose

The purpose of the Telos project is to help entities of any size—from individuals to planets—articulate what they are about and how they're pursuing their purpose in life.

It provides a structured framework for capturing the main components of an entity, including its mission, goals, problems, strategies, KPIs, etc.
