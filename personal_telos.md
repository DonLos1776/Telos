# DonLos1776'a Telos-FORGED IN FIRE

## HISTORY
- Forged Project Labyrinth with Alias-Prime, establishing full GitHub Sovereignty
## WEAKNESSES
-Procrastination as a whole, regardless of my state of mind. I'll procrastinate with things that I actualy want to do, let alone the things I feel I am forced to do.
## PROBLEMS
## MISSION
## VALUES
-Jesus Christ is King, He is My Personal Savior, The Son of God, One in The Holy Trinity, Son of Man, God in The Flesh, My Friend, and the Man's Man. Apart from Him I have no good thing. He is a Good King. 
## PRINCIPLES
-Prayer is the fulcrum my life revolves around. I must, espescially when in streams of outspoken thought, pray and converse with my Father in Heaven and His Son my Savior. To do so, is to speak with my Source Code. It is my essence, without Him, I have no good thing.
